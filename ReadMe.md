## Summary
This is for tracking mileage for trips taken on behalf of work.

This answers questions like :
*'How many Miles did I travel for work this month?'*<br />
*'Can I get a printed log of the trips I have traveled for work?'*<br /><br />

**Motivation**<br />
Independant contractors can use their gas-milegae and car-expenses for tax purposes. Keeping track of these expenses can be difficult, time-consuming, and laborious.<br />
This web-app is a quick-and-easy mileage tracker designed to host a centralized source for business-related trips taken in a vehicle.
